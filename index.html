      What this does Whenever Git Bash starts, it loads .bash_profile. That
      bash_profile just says: “if .bashrc exists, load it too”. So your custom
      config will now always load automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you want me to also give you a clean, ready-made .bash_profile +
      .bashrc combo (so you can copy both files and have a perfect setup)?

      This structure encourages group collaboration, communication, and learning
      best practices for Git. Each student gets hands-on experience, while the
      group leader manages the overall workflow and conflict resolution.
