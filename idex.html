      🔹 What this does Whenever Git Bash starts, it loads .bash_profile. That
      .bash_profile just says: “if .bashrc exists, load it too”. So your custom
      config will now always load automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you want me to also give you a clean, ready-made .bash_profile +
      .bashrc combo (so you can copy both files and have a perfect setup)?
